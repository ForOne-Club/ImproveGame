## BUG Fixes

- Scarecrow dummy falls through floor when chilled
- Infinite Tesla Potion (Calamity Mod) has no effect sometimes

## Adjustments

- Vein Mining Popup can be disabled for good now
- Ability to favorite items in the fishing machine to prevent them from being deposited
- Scarecrow dummy improvements:
  - Now will purge all debuffs when tracking resets
  - Despawing the dummy will reset tracking now
